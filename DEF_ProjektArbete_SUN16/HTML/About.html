            Our saga starts in January 2017. A team of three individuals started a journey towards
            freedom in the shape random events that would eventually turn them in to game developers. No one would know the outcome, especially not these guys.
            <br /> <br />
            <h5>Emir Masic:</h5> A lonely man in the eyes of the common peasent.
            He had a voice that could make a wolverine purr and suits so fine they made Sinatra look like a hobo.
            <br /><br />
            <h5>Daniel Carlsson:</h5> A whiskey loving man, famous for his common expression:
            I love scotch. Scotchy scotch scotch. Here it goes down, down into my belly. Alson known for his
            many leather-bound books and that his apartment smells of rich mahogany.
            <br /><br />
            <h5>Fredrik Wängelin:</h5> After years spent at a job that required 50 IQ, They did studies
            and found out that 60 percent of the time, Fredrik worked every time. Also known for his
            distinct catch frase: I love Lamp. Fredrik used to poop in the refrigirator and eat the
            whole wheel of cheese.
            <br /> <br /> <br />
            Between them and their experience, there is nothing these guys can't do.  <br /> <br />
            An early variation of tic-tac-toe was played in the Roman Empire, around the first century BC.
            It was called Terni Lapilli and instead of having any number of pieces, each player only had three, thus they had to move them around to empty spaces to keep playing.
            The game's grid markings have been found chalked all over Rome. However, according to Claudia Zaslavsky's book Tic Tac Toe:
            And Other Three-In-A Row Games from Ancient Egypt to the Modern Computer, Tic-tac-toe could be traced back to ancient Egypt.
            Another closely related ancient game is Three Men's Morris which is also played on a simple grid and requires three pieces in a row to finish.
            The different names of the game are more recent . The first print reference to "noughts and crosses", the British name, appeared in 1864.
            In his novel "Can You Forgive Her", 1864, Anthony Trollope refers to a clerk playing "tit-tat-toe". The first print reference to a game called "tick-tack-toe" occurred in 1884,
            but referred to "a children's game played on a slate, consisting in trying with the eyes shut to bring the pencil down on one of the numbers of a set, the number hit being scored".
            "Tic-tac-toe" may also derive from "tick-tack", the name of an old version of backgammon first described in 1558. The U.S. renaming of Noughts and crosses as tic-tac-toe occurred in the 20th century.
            In 1952, OXO (or Noughts and Crosses), developed by British computer scientist Alexander S. Douglas for the EDSAC computer at the University of Cambridge, became one of the first known video games.
            The computer player could play perfect games of tic-tac-toe against a human opponent.
            In 1975, tic-tac-toe was also used by MIT students to demonstrate the computational power of Tinkertoy elements.
            The Tinkertoy computer, made out of (almost) only Tinkertoys, is able to play tic-tac-toe perfectly.
            It is currently on display at the Museum of Science, Boston.
            <br /><br />
            Despite its apparent simplicity, Tic-tac-toe requires detailed analysis to determine even some elementary combinatory facts,
            the most interesting of which are the number of possible games and the number of possible positions. A position is merely a state of the board, while a game usually refers to the way a terminal position is obtained.
            Naive counting leads to 19,683 possible board layouts (39 since each of the nine spaces can be X, O or blank), and 362,880 (i.e., 9!) possible games (different sequences for placing the Xs and Os on the board).
            However, two matters much reduce these numbers: <br />
            The game ends when three-in-a-row is obtained.
            <br />
            If X starts, the number of Xs is always either equal to or exactly 1 more than the number of Os.
